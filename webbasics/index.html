    <p>The assingment for this website is as follows: You will be creating a website using the HTML and CSS skills we have learned.  The specific content that you include is up to you, but you may include: work experience, areas of expertise or interest, personal information, career goals, hobbies, etc.  It is fine if the entire site contains fictitious information. For submission, your site will be uploaded to github and viewable via Github Pages (detailed instructions were reviewed in lectures and exercises from week 6 and 7) and the URL from your Github Pages project assignment folder for your site will be submitted for grading. So...what unites the following pages is NOTHING. Maybe the fact that they are English words and I thought of them.</p>
